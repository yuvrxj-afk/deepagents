# langchain-quickjs

A [`deepagents`](../deepagents) middleware that gives an agent a persistent, sandboxed **JavaScript REPL** tool, backed by [`quickjs-rs`](../../../quickjs-wasm) (QuickJS embedded via PyO3 + rquickjs).

Instead of issuing N serial tool calls, the model can write one block of JavaScript that orchestrates work in-loop — variables and functions defined in one call survive into the next, `Promise.all` runs concurrent work, and (opt-in) agent tools are callable from inside the REPL as `await tools.<name>(...)`.

```python
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from langchain_quickjs import REPLMiddleware

agent = create_deep_agent(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    middleware=[REPLMiddleware()],
)
```

## Why

Tool calling is fine for small, discrete requests. It falls apart when the model needs to:

- loop over a list and call a tool per item
- run two independent tool calls concurrently
- compute something between calls (aggregate, filter, dedupe, format)
- reuse intermediate state across several turns

Each of those currently costs one round-trip to the model per step. With a REPL, all of it happens in one `eval` call. This enables [programmatic tool calling](#programmatic-tool-calling-ptc) where the model writes JavaScript that invokes the agent's own tools.

## Install

```bash
uv add langchain-quickjs
```

`langchain-quickjs` depends on `quickjs-rs`, a PyO3 extension module that ships prebuilt wheels for macOS, Linux, and Windows on CPython 3.11+.

## Quick start

```python
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from langchain_quickjs import REPLMiddleware

agent = create_deep_agent(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    middleware=[REPLMiddleware()],
)

# Use `ainvoke` — PTC bridges register as async QuickJS host functions,
# and sync `invoke` on a REPL with async bridges raises ConcurrentEvalError.
result = await agent.ainvoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}]})
```

The middleware:

1. registers an `eval` tool (configurable name) that runs JS in a persistent context;
2. appends a short system-prompt snippet explaining the tool's semantics (sandbox, timeout, memory limit);
3. gives every LangGraph `thread_id` its own QuickJS `Runtime`, so two conversations can't see each other's globals.

## What the REPL is

### Persistence

The REPL is module-flavoured: top-level `let`/`const`/`function` persist across `eval` calls within the same run. Assign to `globalThis.X` to keep a value around under an explicit name.

```js
// call 1
const fib = (n) => (n < 2 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2));

// call 2
fib(10)  // 55
```

### Sandbox

The REPL runs in a QuickJS context with **no ambient capabilities**. There is no filesystem, no network, no `fetch`, no `require`, no real clock (`Date.now()` is whatever QuickJS provides, not wall-clock for security-sensitive uses), no `process`, no `import` of anything you didn't explicitly install.

Escape hatches, if you want them, go through explicit middleware:

- **PTC** — to call into the agent's own tools (see below).
- **Skills** — to pre-install JS/TS modules the agent can `import`.

### Console capture

`console.log` / `console.warn` / `console.error` are captured by default and returned as a `<stdout>` block alongside the result, separately truncated. Disable with `capture_console=False` if you'd rather the guest see no `console` at all.

```js
console.log("hi", 2);
1 + 1
```

```xml
<stdout>
hi 2
</stdout>
<result>2</result>
```

### Timeouts and memory

Each call has a per-call wall-clock timeout (default 5 s). Breaching it produces:

```xml
<error type="Timeout">...</error>
```

The runtime has a shared memory limit across every context under it (default 64 MiB). OOM surfaces as:

```xml
<error type="OutOfMemory">...</error>
```

PTC host-function calls are also budgeted per eval call (default 256 `tools.*`
invocations). Exceeding the budget surfaces as:

```xml
<error type="PTCCallBudgetExceeded">...</error>
```

Set `max_ptc_calls=None` only in trusted environments. Disabling the
budget allows unbounded PTC-call loops and increases DoS risk.

Top-level `await` works on the async path — the promise settles before the call returns. An un-resolvable top-level promise (no host work in flight, no resolver) surfaces as `<error type="Deadlock">`.

### Result formatting

Every eval renders into one wire format consumed by the model:

| Outcome | Rendered as |
| --- | --- |
| Marshalable value | `<result>{json-ish}</result>` |
| Function or unmarshalable | `<result kind="handle">[Function] arity=2</result>` |
| JS-level throw | `<error type="TypeError">{message}\n{stack}</error>` |
| Timeout / deadlock / OOM | `<error type="Timeout" \| "Deadlock" \| "OutOfMemory">...</error>` |
| `console.*` output | separate `<stdout>...</stdout>` block |

Results and stdout are independently truncated to `max_result_chars` (default 4000) before being sent back to the model.

Numeric rendering follows Node's REPL convention — whole-valued floats (`42.0`) render as integers (`42`) so the model isn't confused by JS's single numeric type.

## Programmatic tool calling (PTC)

PTC is the reason to use this middleware over a plain code-interpreter tool. When configured, each exposed tool is available inside the REPL as:

```ts
async tools.<camelCaseName>(input: {...}): Promise<string>
```

So an agent with a `search_web` tool and a `summarize` tool can do:

```js
const results = await Promise.all([
  tools.searchWeb({ query: "deepagents" }),
  tools.searchWeb({ query: "quickjs" }),
]);

await tools.summarize({ text: results.join("\n\n") })
```

...in **one** `eval` call — three tool invocations, zero round-trips to the model between them.

### Enabling it

```python
REPLMiddleware()                              # disabled (default)
REPLMiddleware(ptc=["search_web"])            # explicit allowlist
REPLMiddleware(ptc=[search_tool])             # explicit tool object allowlist
```

The REPL's own tool is always excluded from PTC; `tools.eval("tools.eval(...)")` would be pointless recursion, and if the model wants nested code it can just write nested code in one call.

### What the model sees

When PTC is on, the system-prompt snippet grows an *API Reference — `tools` namespace* section listing every exposed tool as a TypeScript-ish signature derived from the tool's args schema:

```ts
/** Search the web for the given query. */
async tools.searchWeb(input: {
  /** The query string. */
  query: string;
  /** Max results. */
  limit?: number;
}): Promise<string>
```

Enums, `anyOf` unions, nested objects, and arrays are all supported by the schema renderer. Opaque types fall back to `Record<string, unknown>` — the description is usually enough.

### How it works (so you can debug it)

- Each PTC-exposed tool gets a QuickJS host-function bridge registered under a generated `__tools_*` global symbol. The bridge is async, so the guest sees `tools.x(...)` as returning a `Promise`.
- `globalThis.tools` is rebuilt every turn from the currently-exposed name set. So if an upstream middleware filters tools on a per-turn basis, the `tools` namespace follows along.
- When the bridge invokes a tool, it forwards the `ToolRuntime` captured from the outer `eval` call — so subagent tools like `task` see graph `state`, `store`, `context`, and a synthesised child `tool_call_id`.
- Tool return values are coerced to strings: strings pass through, `ToolMessage`s get unwrapped, a `Command` has its last-message content extracted, everything else gets `json.dumps`'d.

## Skills: importable JS/TS modules

If your agent uses `SkillsMiddleware` (from `deepagents`), any skill whose frontmatter includes a `module:` key becomes dynamically importable inside the REPL:

```js
const helpers = await import("@/skills/my-helpers");
helpers.greet("world")
```

Under the hood:

- At eval time, the middleware scans the source for literal `"@/skills/<name>"` specifiers.
- For each referenced skill, it fetches the skill directory through your `BackendProtocol`, packages every typescript file into a module scope, and installs it under the bare specifier.
- Installs are cached per-`Runtime` — each skill loads at most once, and a broken skill is cached as an error so it doesn't re-hit the backend every eval.
- If a skill referenced in source isn't available or fails to install, the eval call short-circuits with `<error type="SkillNotAvailable">...</error>` — the model sees a clean failure instead of a guest-side `ReferenceError`.
- Skills are isolated: one skill's scope can't bare-import another. Bundle shared code into each skill or re-export through a single skill.

Enable it by passing the same `BackendProtocol` your `SkillsMiddleware` uses:

```python
REPLMiddleware(skills_backend=my_backend)
```

There's a hard cap of 1 MiB per skill bundle. If you hit it, split the skill or prune generated code.

## Configuration reference

```python
REPLMiddleware(
    memory_limit=64 * 1024 * 1024,  # bytes, shared across contexts
    timeout=5.0,                     # per-call seconds
    max_ptc_calls=256,     # per-eval `tools.*` bridge calls, None disables (DoS risk)
    tool_name="eval",                # what the model calls it
    max_result_chars=4000,           # result/stdout truncation, each
    capture_console=True,            # install console.log/warn/error bridge
    ptc=None,                        # None | list[str] | list[BaseTool]
    skills_backend=None,             # BackendProtocol for @/skills/<name> imports
)
```

## Errors the model can see

| Type | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, ... | User-code error. Re-surfaces the JS error name verbatim. |
| `Timeout` | Call exceeded `timeout=`. |
| `OutOfMemory` | Runtime hit `memory_limit=`. |
| `PTCCallBudgetExceeded` | Uncaught `tools.*` call-budget overflow in one eval (`max_ptc_calls=`). |
| `Deadlock` | Top-level promise never resolved with no async host work in flight. |
| `ConcurrentEval` | Shouldn't happen under locks; defensive mapping for QuickJS `ConcurrentEvalError`. |
| `SkillNotAvailable` | Source referenced `@/skills/<name>` we couldn't resolve or install. |

`asyncio.CancelledError` propagates out cleanly when JS declines to catch a `HostCancellationError` — so LangGraph cancellation semantics work end-to-end.
